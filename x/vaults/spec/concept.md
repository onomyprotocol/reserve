## Concept

The Vaults module enables users to create and manage vaults secured by collateral assets. Users can deposit assets as collateral and mint a specified amount of tokens based on the collateral ratio. The module ensures that the minted tokens and collateral adhere to a minimum collateralization ratio, thus maintaining the stability and solvency of the system.

### Key Features
- **Vault Creation**: Users can lock supported assets as collateral in their vaults and mint stable asset
- **Collateral Management**: User can deposit more collateral asset into vault or withdraw their collateral.
- **Debt Management**: User can burn stable tokens to reduce their debt or mint more tokens as long as the collateral ratio of the vault meets the necessary threshold.
- **Liquidation**: Vaults that fall below the required collateral ratio can be subject to liquidation to maintain the stability and security of the system. The liquidation process involves seizing and selling the collateral to repay the outstanding debt and ensure that the system remains solvent.
